# Gimp Roulette 2 player game
Old "russian roulette" game for 2 players, original by Crazy Bonkers.

Flash, Winsock TCP/IP, Chat, Server and Client - all in one application - and it's a multiplayer Internet/Network-Game. If you want you can call it: Russian Roulette. How does it work: Sends your local action FIRST to the Winsock-Control and execute it directly from the Winsock-Control, eg. Jump to the right flash-Frame. 

---- Key-Features: 
* Animations in Flash 
* Control Flash-Frames trough VB 
* Push variables into a Flash-File 
* TCP/IP Server and client in one application 
* Chat- Server/Client * shows, if opponent gone offline 
* Learn how to use Winsock to control another app 
* Handshakes at winsock-load and -unload 
* Background-Sound 
* Statistics (Percent-Bar) 
* Ini-File - Support 
* clean and comented Code. 
* Includes the .fla-File, to show how it works. 

---- Bugs: None (If you find one, you can fix them)
